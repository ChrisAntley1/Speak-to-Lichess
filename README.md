TODO:

Create options page to allow users to manage their replaced words.

Inform content script when the user adds another word to the replace list from popup.
--complete! (i think)

Replace arrays of spelled out numbers, other word arrays with maps (probably).
--complete
Check the spoken phrase such that the iterable list of words can have trouble words replaced; especially
such that trouble words can be replaced by more than one word if needed.
--set up to implement this
Consider other options for default keybindings.

Check resulting phrase for 2 coordinate format, and handle appropriately.
--remembered that lichess doesn't like this for some reason, with pieces other than pawns.

Create option for user to change diction language; perhaps a new default trouble word set as well.
